# fitbitanalysis
This project aims to help you apply what you have learned about data processing, visualization,
and statistical analysis to a real-world dataset. You will use the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data from
Kaggle for this purpose. The dataset contains minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate,
and sleep monitoring. In this project, you will explore relationships between exercise, sleep, and
energy expenditure.
